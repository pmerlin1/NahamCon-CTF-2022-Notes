# Recurse CTF
> Author: @congon4tor#2334

Another web challenge. Particularly challenging due to so many rabbit holes you can fall in to, but the solution is simple. Still only 5 out of 1000+ CTF participants got this during competition. Hat tip to congon4tor for giving a few hints after competition on how to resolve this.
